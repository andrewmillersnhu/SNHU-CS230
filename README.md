In an effort to expand its player base, gaming company The Gaming Room is looking to develop a multi-platform version of its current game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is currently available on Android only, but The Gaming Room would like to serve customers on a web-based platform as well as iOS devices.

I believe I did particularly well in the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each operating platform for various purposes of the game.

Working from the design template made developing code easier as you have a blueprint for what you are trying to achieve. A visual guide to demonstrate what is needed, as opposed to just coding blindly.

One part of the document I would change would be the recommendations. While I am confident that my recommendations are suitable for the client, I do think my rationale and explanations could have been more in-depth.
